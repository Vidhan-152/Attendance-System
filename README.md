# 📸 Attendance System Using OpenCV
  Welcome to the Attendance System project! 🎉 This project uses OpenCV to recognize faces and manage attendance efficiently. Whether you're a student, teacher, or developer, this system is designed to make attendance tracking a breeze. 🙌

## 🚀 Features
  Face Recognition: Automatically detects and recognizes faces.
  Attendance Logging: Records the attendance of recognized faces in live time firebase console.
  Real-Time Processing: Fast and efficient, using OpenCV for real-time operations.
  User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive to use.

  
## 🛠️ Installation
  Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/Vidhan-152/attendance-system.git

  For the serviceAccountkey.json, you have to make your own account at firebase console. Mine will not work for you!
  

## 📂 Project Structure
  main.py - Main script to run the attendance system.
  requirements.txt - List of dependencies.
  database - Directory containing images of faces to be recognized.
  firebase - File where attendance records are stored and in live time.
  
  
## 👩‍💻 How It Works
  Add Faces: Place images of individuals in the database.
  Run the Script: Execute the main script to start the system.
  Capture Attendance: The system will automatically recognize faces and log their attendance.
